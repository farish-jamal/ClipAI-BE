- Create emotional beats that rise and fall naturally
- Include conversational pauses and rhythm markers (e.g., "you know what happened next?")
- Build relatability through universal emotions or culturally specific references
- End with memorable impact‚Äîwhether inspirational, humorous, shocking, or thought-provoking
